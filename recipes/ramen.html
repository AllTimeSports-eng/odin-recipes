    <h3> Description </h3>

    <p> Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our favorite curly-cue packaged ramen noodles that remind us of college?
         That’s this homemade ramen. </p>

    <p> If today is your day for an authentic Japanese cooking adventure, I highly recommend Nami’s amazing blog Just One Cookbook. </p>
        
    <p>On the flip side, this recipe leans more in the direction of I-have-a-package-of-ramen-and-some-vegetables-can-we-make-lunch practical. Sort of healthy and
         fast and a little nostalgic (packaged ramen!) but also fresh-ly delicious with a ton of flavor.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Ramen noodles (our classic Maruchan package is all we need, sans the seasoning!)</li>
        <li> Garlic and ginger</li>
        <li> Broth (chicken or veg)</li>
        <li> Dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li> Veggies like carrots or kale</li>
        <li> All your favorite toppings like some panko, egg, chili oil, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Directions </h3>

    <ol> 
        <li> Stir-Fry Aromatics: Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.</li>
        <li>Make Your (Easy!) Broth: Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.</li>
        <li>Add Noodles: Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions (more flavor, please!).</li>
        <li>Add Veg: Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you’d like! Cook until just tender.</li>
        <li>Top It Off: Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce, whatever your heart desires.</li>
    </ol>
