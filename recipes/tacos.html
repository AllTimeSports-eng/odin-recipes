    <h3> Description </h3>

    <p> 
        We’ve never met a taco we didn’t like. In fact, some of our favorite childhood memories are smelling the marrying of flavors from the taco truck and eagerly awaiting our turn for 
        the perfect bite. And now, without having to use every dish in the kitchen, we’ve made the best chicken taco recipe! These chicken thigh tacos are filling, quick, and, even better, 
        you might even have most of the ingredients on hand. Mouthwatering chicken is wrapped in warm tortillas and sprinkled with salsa, cilantro, and all your favorite toppings. It’s adaptable 
        for all tastes, so we like to let the kids (and adults, too!) make their own – all you’ll need to do is marinate and cook the chicken, warm up the tortillas and place all the toppings 
        out for friends and family to enjoy.

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shredded cheeses like mozzarella, Monterey, or pepper jack cheese</li>

        <li>Crispy romaine lettuce</li>
            
        <li> Sliced avocado</li>
            
        <li>Chopped red or white onion</li>
            
        <li>Chopped cilantro</li>
            
        <li>Pico de gallo or chopped Roma tomatoes</li>
            
        <li>Sour cream</li>
            
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Directions </h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Make the chicken taco marinade! Three pantry ingredients come together to make this delicious marinade for our chicken thigh tacos.</li>
        <li> Cook the chicken! Choose the method that works best for you: Grill, stovetop, or oven! We like grilling chicken for its added smokiness and its quickness (give or take 10 minutes!) 
              but the other methods work well, too!</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas! While your chicken is resting to lock in the juiciness, simply use a hot pan, and heat up your tortillas. Cover them with a towel to keep them warm.</li>
        <li>Assemble the chicken taco! Our favorite part is mixing and matching our toppings. This is a great way to get the entire family involved!</li>
    </ol>
